      <div class="box">
        <p>Dear Aila,</p>
        <p>Happy 2nd Monthary Baby. There's something important i want to express and I believe
        putting it into words will allow us to communicate and understand each other better.  Lately, 
        our relationship has been marked by frequent arguments and disagreements, I want you to know that
        i am fully aware of my role in this.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, I want to apologize for my attitude and the way I've been behaving. I realize
        that my actions have caused unnecessary stress and tension between us, and that's the last thing I ever wanted.
        You deserve nothing but love, respect, and happiness in our relationship, and i have not been living up to those expectations.
        I want you to know that I am commited to working on myself and improving the way I handle conflicts. I promise to make a conscious effort to be more understanding, patient, and kind. I know I can do better, and I am determined to be the partner you deserve.</p>

        <p>Please understand that my intentions have always been rooted in love. I deeply care for you, and I want us to have a healthy and harmonious relationship 
        Let's find ways to communicate more effectively, to listen to each other's concerns without judgment, and to seek compromise instead of confrontation.
        I want to assure you that i am taking responsibility for my behavior, and i am actively seeking personal growth. I am open suggestions, advice, and any guidance you may offer.
        Together, let's find solutions that work for both of us, so that we can rebuild trust, understanding, and happiness in our relationship.</p>

       <p>I understand that change takes time, but I promise to be persistent in my efforts. I want to create an environment where we both feel safe, supported, and valued.
        I truly believe in our love and the potential we have to overcome any obstacles that come our way.
        Thank you for your patience, your unwavering love, and your belief in us. I am grateful for your presence in my life,
        and I am committed to making things right. Let's learn from our past mistakes, grow stronger together, and create a future filled with love, laughter, and peace.</p>
    
        <p>Thank you for being the most incredible partner I could ever ask for. Here's to our 2nd Monthsary, and to many more months of love, laughter, and togetherness. You mean the world to me, and I am excited to continue this beautiful journey with you.</p>
